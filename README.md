# About
This project (Locomanipulation Task) is meant to test and explore the concept
of high-level learning and motion planning with dynamic options.
It improves on simple logical planning in PDDL to allow the high level planner to be informed by the low
level world state.

# Using
This file contains a few scripts which can be run
* main.py -             collect data from Treasure Game
* data_clustering.py -  analyze collected data from main.py
* scripts/*.py       -  misc. support scripts

The paper itself is a conglomoration of around a decade of Konidaris's work,
is 75 pages long, and is a journal publication summarizing many other publications.
