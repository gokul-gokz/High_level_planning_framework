USER NOTE: The file map.tmx is a file of Tiled format.

Tiled is a bootleg .xml format output by the open-source
[Tiled Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org)

I would explain the format here, but it's waaay better to read the
docs on the website itself.  Basically, it's an easy way to represent
a grid-based game, with very little coding effort.
